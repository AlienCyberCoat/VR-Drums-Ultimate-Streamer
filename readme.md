░░░░░**Streaming**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Beware streaming or video capture software can demand a lot from your computers resources. Streaming or video capture software can effect your available memory and resources in turn limiting VRDUS tracking precision. Make sure your capture software and settings don't effect VRDUS performance to much for comfortable gameplay. Limiting lights in the scene can free up memory and increase FPS.

To capture with OBS, right click the source and make sure the capture method is set to Windows 10 (1903 and up). Note: Good tracking performance is everything in VRDUS for comfort drumming and streaming at high quality can cause tracking performance to dip. Make sure to configure and test your settings accordingly if you are low on system resources.


░░░░░**Display**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

VRDUS will launch fullscreen. To minimize VRDUS into a moveable desktop window press Alt + Enter while in game.


░░░░░**Custom Face Textures**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Enter the configuration menu and find the tab with your drummer settings. 

Check the checkbox Custom Face Texture. Enter the URL of your hosted image. It can be any image on the web. To get an image address location for use in VRDUS. Right click an image in your web browser and select "copy image address" or it maybe "copy image location" depending what browswer you are using. 

If you would like to add a picture of your own face, or design your own makeup and custom face texture yourself. Download a copy of our "Custom Face Texture.png" which and be viewed or downloaded here.

Import the "Custom Face Texture.png" into your favorite images editor and draw anything you like on the templete. Create a new image layer, draw over or under the UV texture coordinates. When you are done, save your image, delete the UV cordinates layer and upload your new image to anywhere on the web where you can get a URL images location as mentioned above and paste that address into the "Custom Face Texture" input field on VRDUS.

░░░░░**MIDI**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

To have VR Drums Ultimate Streamer communicate to an internal MIDI synthesizer (Windows comes with a MIDI synthesizer build into it: the Microsoft GS Wavetable synth) or with external hardware like a synthesizer using MIDI, connected to Windows. Launch the MidiBridge.exe file located in VRDUS root installation folder.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/159b793f-310e-474b-9e2b-6b7eeaf0c688)

Once loaded MidiBridge.exe will scan Windows OS for any connected MIDI synthesizer or devices running on Windows or connected to Windows using Windows MIDI and recognize it under DEVICE NAME.

**In this case an internal software MIDI synthesizer that comes standard and built into Windows OS. The Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth.

It's now waiting for a connection from a MIDI controller, we will use VR Drums Ultimate Streamer as the controller.

Now launch VR Drums Ultimate Streamer. MIDIBridge.exe will accept the connection from VR Drums Ultimate Streamer.
