░░░░░**Streaming**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Beware streaming or video capture software can demand a lot from your computers resources. Streaming or video capture software can effect your available memory and resources in turn limiting VRDUS tracking precision. Make sure your capture software and settings don't effect VRDUS performance to much for comfortable gameplay. Limiting lights in the scene can free up memory and increase FPS.

To capture with OBS, right click the source and make sure the capture method is set to Windows 10 (1903 and up). Note: Good tracking performance is everything in VRDUS for comfort drumming and streaming at high quality can cause tracking performance to dip. Make sure to configure and test your settings accordingly if you are low on system resources.


░░░░░**Display**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

VRDUS will launch fullscreen. To minimize VRDUS into a moveable desktop window press Alt + Enter while in game.


░░░░░**MIDI**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

To have VR Drums Ultimate Streamer communicate to an internal MIDI synthesizer (Windows comes with a MIDI synthesizer build into it: the Microsoft GS Wavetable synth) or with external hardware like a synthesizer using MIDI, connected to Windows. Launch the MidiBridge.exe file located in VRDUS root installation folder.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/159b793f-310e-474b-9e2b-6b7eeaf0c688)

Once loaded MidiBridge.exe will scan Windows OS for any connected MIDI synthesizer or devices running on Windows or connected to Windows using Windows MIDI and recognize it under DEVICE NAME.

**In this case an internal software MIDI synthesizer that comes standard and built into Windows OS. The Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth.

It's now waiting for a connection from a MIDI controller, we will use VR Drums Ultimate Streamer as the controller.

Now launch VR Drums Ultimate Streamer. MIDIBridge.exe will accept the connection from VR Drums Ultimate Streamer.
