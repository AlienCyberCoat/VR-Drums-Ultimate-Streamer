░░░░░**Streaming**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Beware streaming or video capture software can demand a lot from your computers resources and lower the accuracy of tracking. Make sure your capture software settings don't effect VRDUS performance to much to retain comfortable gameplay. Limiting the amount of lights in the scene can free up memory and increase FPS.

To capture with OBS, right click the source and make sure the capture method is set to Windows 10 (1903 and up). Note: Good tracking performance is everything in VRDUS and streaming at high quality can cause tracking performance to dip. Make sure to configure and test your settings accordingly.


░░░░░**Play Custom Songs/Chart Files**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Files can be anywhere on your computer but must follow directory structure to work when you select your .MP3 in the Note Shop. Example below. 

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/7ef8a560-d544-4be4-98d4-4af907e44aea)

Only make a sub directory for the .mp3 file in Songs. Example.

Songs/korn/korn.mp3 (Required: The .mp3 file)

The rest of the package to your song goes in /Songs. Example.

Songs/korn.chart           (Required: The .chart file)

Songs/korn.jpg             (Optional: The image for the album art)

Songs/korn_advanced.chart  (Optional: Only needed for advanced charts)

░░░░░**Create Custom Songs/Chart Files**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Download FeedBack. You can find the file on our GitHub VRDUS Repository. Link below.

https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer

These are the basic note tracks for the chart for VR Drums Ultimate Streamer. If you want to create an advanced chart you can create a chart 2 file with bass, ride and crash 2, more on that below soon.

FeedBack and the colors to drums.

Where the notes from FeedBack will be played on the real kit.

Place your MP3 file in a sub directory in FeedBacks /Songs folder (example /Songs/MySong). While in FeedBack hit the TAB key to bring up the main menu. Select NEW CHART.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/390fe162-68f9-4ee4-aee9-7f256bd70fe1)

Locate and select your .MP3 you want to make a chart for.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/54b8c663-22db-4b3d-9d8a-f52cd96515af)

Once your file is selected another screen will now appear. None of these settings matter, you can skip them, but if you like add in the "Charters Name", that is you. Also "Arist Name" being the band or performer. Select exit.

Now hit tab again, select the track "gutair" and then difficultly to "easy guitar". This will be our basic drum chart.

You must know the BPM (beats per minute) of your song /.MP3 file. Set the BPM in FeedBack to your songs BPM with these keys.

**equal key** - increase BPM

**minus key** - decrease BPM

Most songs have BPM listed on the internet if searched. If your song is not studio recorded it will probably start offset and off beat, not aligning with the grid in FeedBack. This can make charting a chore. 

You can start laying out your chart file.

Keys*****

up - move chart forward

down - move chart backward

space - play song

/ - slow down music (can help with finding a beat to chart)

left - increase beat step

right - decrease beat step

= increase BPM

- decrease BPM

Keys placing Notes*****
1 key - green 
2 key - red 
3 key - yellow 
4 key - blue 
5 key - orange 

Tips.

Bring up the VR Drums Ultimate Streamer note chart image beside FeedBack editor while you are charting a song to help remember what instrument you are using. Example below.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/7b398513-b781-4c04-afae-c528f8808ede)

Replay your song with SPACE key as much as you like and match your notes however you like.

When you are done, go to the end of your song on the chart and hit the "E" key and type "end" and press enter. This will place an end point of the chart.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/7ee63497-abaa-4b62-9fc5-3adcb9266cec)

Hit Escape key to bring up the main menu. Select "Save Chart". Now locate the folder you have FeedBack installed and you will find a directory under "Songs" of your new .chart file.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/962663fc-03be-4b93-8e26-491c3f6244fb)

Inside the folder is the .mp3 and the .chart file. These can be copied to VRDUS and now played. Read below.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/869633b9-ced4-421a-bb62-21fbc12be50a)

░░░░░**Advanced Charts**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Making a second chart file for the same song you can access more drums for example, the bass, ride and large crash.

Make a new chart in FeedBack and hit tab again, select the track "drums" and then difficultly to "expert drums". This will be our advance drum chart.

Just name your the second chart file the same as the first but add _advanced (Example metalsong.chart / metalsong_advanced.chart)

The first 5 strings will read from chart 1 (metalsong.chart). While the extra instruments on 6-9 string are being read from the advanced chart (metalsong_advanced.chart)

**Basic Chart (example: mysong.chart)** track: guitar | difficulty: easy guitar

**With Advanced Chart (example: mysong_advanced.chart)** track: drums | difficulty: expert drums

░░░░░**MIDI**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

To have VR Drums Ultimate Streamer communicate to an internal MIDI synthesizer (Windows comes with a MIDI synthesizer build into it: the Microsoft GS Wavetable synth) or with external hardware like a synthesizer using MIDI, connected to Windows. Launch the MidiBridge.exe file located in VRDUS root installation folder.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/159b793f-310e-474b-9e2b-6b7eeaf0c688)

Once loaded MidiBridge.exe will scan Windows OS for any connected MIDI synthesizer or devices running on Windows or connected to Windows using Windows MIDI and recognize it under DEVICE NAME.

**In this case an internal software MIDI synthesizer that comes standard and built into Windows OS. The Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth.

It's now waiting for a connection from a MIDI controller, we will use VR Drums Ultimate Streamer as the controller.
