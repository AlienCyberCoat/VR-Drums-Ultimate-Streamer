VRDUS can require a lot from your computers resources. 60+ FPS is recommended for good tracking precision and accuracy. Make sure your PC settings don't effect performance to much for comfortable gameplay. Limiting lights, and extra cameras in the scene can free up memory and increase FPS. You should have no lag. There is a performance option you can check in-game if you are struggling with reaching 60+ FPS.

Beware streaming or video capture software can demand a lot from your computers resources and lower the accuracy of tracking. Make sure your capture software settings don't effect VRDUS performance to much to retain comfortable gameplay. Limiting the amount of lights in the scene can free up memory and increase FPS.

To capture with OBS, right click the source and make sure the capture method is set to Windows 10 (1903 and up). Note: Good tracking performance is everything in VRDUS and streaming at high quality can cause tracking performance to dip. Make sure to configure and test your settings accordingly.

You must know the BPM (beats per minute) of your song /.MP3 file. Set the BPM in FeedBack to your songs BPM with these keys.

**equal key** - increase BPM

**minus key** - decrease BPM

Most songs have BPM listed on the internet if searched. If your song is not studio recorded it will probably start offset and off beat, not aligning with the grid in FeedBack. This can make charting a chore. You can set an offset to any song in FeedBack.
