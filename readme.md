░░░░░**Streaming**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Beware streaming or video capture software can demand a lot from your computers resources and lower the accuracy of tracking. Make sure your capture software settings don't effect VRDUS performance to much to retain comfortable gameplay. Limiting the amount of lights in the scene can free up memory and increase FPS.

To capture with OBS, right click the source and make sure the capture method is set to Windows 10 (1903 and up). Note: Good tracking performance is everything in VRDUS and streaming at high quality can cause tracking performance to dip. Make sure to configure and test your settings accordingly.


░░░░░**Play Custom Songs/Chart Files**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Files can be anywhere on your computer but must follow directory structure to work when you select your .MP3 in the Note Shop. Example below. 

The Directory Structure (In this case all our stuff is in /Songs)

Sub directories are only for the song MP3 file. Named the same as the MP3 filename.

Everything else for the song goes in /Songs.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/45c49b48-35a0-4378-b08f-ce917b9e3320)

paintBlack.chart - The chart file
paintBlack.jpg - The Album Art or any photo you like to be displayed in-game.
paintBlack_highway.jpg - Underscore MP3 filename with _highway for the custom note highway display image in-game.
paintBlack2.chart - Chart 2 files are not needed, it's considered advanced gameplay, if you wish to use a chart 2 file you can access more instruments, like the bass pedal, in your readable chart file in-game. More on that in "Creating Custom Charts" section.

Now in game select the Note Shop.

![image](https://github.com/AlienCyberCoat/VR-Drums-Ultimate-Streamer/assets/77039180/d7882e18-695a-418d-8fb1-4fbc0a85fa5b)

Now when you are in the Note Shop, select your MP3 file and your song will load in-game and ready do play along with the chart.

Find your directory.

░░░░░**MIDI**░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

To have VR Drums Ultimate Streamer communicate to an internal MIDI synthesizer (Windows comes with a MIDI synthesizer build into it: the Microsoft GS Wavetable synth) or with external hardware like a synthesizer using MIDI, connected to Windows. Launch the MidiBridge.exe file located in VRDUS root installation folder.

Once loaded MidiBridge.exe will scan Windows OS for any connected MIDI synthesizer or devices running on Windows or connected to Windows using Windows MIDI and recognize it under DEVICE NAME.

**In this case an internal software MIDI synthesizer that comes standard and built into Windows OS. The Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth.

It's now waiting for a connection from a MIDI controller, we will use VR Drums Ultimate Streamer as the controller.
