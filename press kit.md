Description:

VR Drums Ultimate Streamer is a physics based VR drum kit simulator that has been in development for over 2 years. Our app emulates owning a personal drum kit that you can play, practice, learn, modify and move around your individual drums and cymbals. You can change the drum head of each drum, just like a real drum, changing it's sound when it's hit. Also add more drums and cymbals to your drum kit. Live the ultimate drumming fantasy inside VR.

Physics5 - The custom drumming physics framework developed over 2 years.

You can also use the VR drum kit and connected it to MIDI module devices through Windows, change the sounds in-game with MIDI output, or your own MIDI sound fonts.

Company story:
Alien Cyber Coat is an American indie game developer. We wanted to develop a VR drum kit when we lost our real life drum kit, and could not own another. We hope this helps people with the same issue. Alien Cyber Coat has been making video games since the early 2000's.
